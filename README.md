gusto
=====
A final scaffold of [gibran framework](https://github.com/jochasinga/gibran) without the CLI and code generation.

Purpose
-------
This code serves as a design sandbox to investigate what it would be like using gibran.
It's free for all to clone and start off a project from it without the **gibran cli** 
that will come with the gibran project. 

Recommend
---------
Please read [Go Interfaces and Delegation Pattern](https://medium.com/code-zen/go-interfaces-and-delegation-pattern-f962c138dc1e#.sob4lzuo5)
to understand how gusto works.
